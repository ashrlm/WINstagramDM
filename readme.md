# WINstagramDM

### About
This is a client for Instagram Direct, to be used on Windows. It is offered as a replacement to Instagrams official Windows app,
as that does not work on many machines, and is, in my opinion, very poorly designed.

### Installation
To run this, you will need Python 3. Once this is downloaded, clone this repo and navigate to the directory where it was installed. From there, open a command line and run
`cd src`, then`python -m pip install pipenv`, followed by `pipenv install`. This will install the required dependencies, and from there, run `pipenv run python main.py`. Alternativlely, download the installer from this repo or [my website]("http://projects.ashrlm.ml/WINstagramDM")
